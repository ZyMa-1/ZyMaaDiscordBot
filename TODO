Todo:
1. Check 'logging_stats' command If it is working (I added glob thingy).
2. Improve logging, make it more flexible, include SQLAlchemy in it.

Ideas:
1. Just get the table of all your scores with most important fields in it (not entire 'Score' model)
^get_xlsx_scores_file
2. Filtering the scores, so they would include given mods (game modifications) and return the same table of them.
^get_filtered_by_mods_xlsx_scores_file
3. Describe flow of the bot, how to do stuff in the readme and ^flow command.
---
4. Get all your scores stored in the osu! bancho server with certain mods
(all +FL scores including +NFFL, +DTFL, etc.)
Firstly download data (will be huge).
Migrate 'scores' table, so it would have is_best (on the beatmap) field.
Modify existing queries and add new ones.
5. Improve bot design/commands interaction flow/UX
6. Keep track command usage (too fancy)
7. Sing glory days
8. Map guessing game
^map_game

Starting 'Guess a map game' for 'user' (All maps that user played would be)

9. Create separate table for storing all (osu_user_id, beatmap_id) kind of things
10. Then obtain 'scores' table according to that table when '^get_all_user_scores' is called
11. Map guessing game is gonna be based on that 'user_beatmaps' table.
12. For future stuff, the storing of the map's status (Graveyard, Pending, Ranked) would be useful.
13. Maybe, just maybe get rid of data utils, database is much much more easy to maintain.
