Todo:
1. Improve logging messages in 'OsuApiUtils.py'
2. Probably the class that would do excel operations
   (method for getting columns, method for getting values needed from the 'Score')
   To ease the flow, class would accept the database filters and itself request the needed scores from the db.
3. No auto-deletion (when time passed) for now,
   but a discord command that would delete all user's scores from the db would ne nice.
4. Work with that and create cool commands!
   Create separate cog for the commands that would use the 'scores' db table.
5. Check 'logging_stats' command If it is working (I added glob thingy).
6. Sending large files on discord may be need to 'zip' them.
7. Maybe somehow ease the way of checking the arguments in commands and parsing them by using some function thingies.
8. Check 'logging_stats' command If it is working (I added glob thingy).
9. Sending large files on discord may be need to 'zip' them.
10. Apply big cooldown to some commands.
11. Implement sending request to be added to trusted users to discord owner?
12. Permission predicates should be separated from db related stuff.

Ideas:
1. Just get the table of all your scores with most important fields in it (not entire 'Score' model)
2. Filtering the scores, so they would include given mods (game modifications) and return the same table of them.
