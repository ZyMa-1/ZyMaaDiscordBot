Todo:
1. Check 'logging_stats' command If it is working (I added glob thingy).
2. Permission predicates should be separated from db related stuff. Probably.
3. Add owner command. As now trusted users and admins files needs to be created manually.
4. Improve and test db speed, especially 'scores' table operations.
5. Add 'mods' INTEGER column to the 'scores' table.

Ideas:
1. Just get the table of all your scores with most important fields in it (not entire 'Score' model)
^get_xlsx_scores_file
2. Filtering the scores, so they would include given mods (game modifications) and return the same table of them.
^get_filtered_by_mods_xlsx_scores_file
3. Describe flow of the bot, how to do stuff in the readme.
