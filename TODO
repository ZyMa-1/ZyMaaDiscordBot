Todo:
1. Check 'logging_stats' command If it is working (I added glob thingy).
2. Improve logging, make it more flexible, include SQLAlchemy in it.

Ideas:
1. Just get the table of all your scores with most important fields in it (not entire 'Score' model)
^get_xlsx_scores_file
2. Filtering the scores, so they would include given mods (game modifications) and return the same table of them.
^get_filtered_by_mods_xlsx_scores_file
3. Describe flow of the bot, how to do stuff in the readme and ^flow command.

4. Get all your scores stored in the osu! bancho server with certain mods
(all +FL scores including +NFFL, +DTFL, etc.)
Firstly download data (will be huge).
Migrate 'scores' table, so it would have is_best (on the beatmap) field.
Modify existing queries and add new ones.
5. Improve bot design/commands interaction flow/UX
6. Keep track command usage (too fancy)
7. Sing glory days
