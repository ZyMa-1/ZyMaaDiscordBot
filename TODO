Todo:
1. Check 'logging_stats' command If it is working (I added glob thingy).
2. Improve logging, make it more flexible, include SQLAlchemy in it.

Ideas:
1. Just get the table of all your scores with most important fields in it (not entire 'Score' model)
^get_xlsx_scores_file
2. Filtering the scores, so they would include given mods (game modifications) and return the same table of them.
^get_filtered_by_mods_xlsx_scores_file
3. Describe flow of the bot, how to do stuff in the readme and ^flow command.
---
4. Get all your scores stored in the osu! bancho server with certain mods
(all +FL scores including +NFFL, +DTFL, etc.) | NO, FUCK YOU FOR NOW!!!
Firstly download data (will be huge).
Migrate 'scores' table, so it would have is_best (on the beatmap) field.
Modify existing queries and add new ones.
5. Improve bot design/commands interaction flow/UX
6. Keep track command usage (not too fancy actually, just track 'on_command' and create new command)
7. Sing glory days
8. Map guessing game
^map_game

Starting 'Guess a map game' for 'user' (All maps that user played would be)

8. Create Dataclasses and models (Done!)
9. Create new command that handle addition to the 'user_played_beatmaps' table.
10. Change the '^load_all_user_scores', so it would obtain scores according to 'user_played_beatmaps' table.
11. Map guessing game is gonna be based on that 'user_played_beatmaps' table.
12. Add disclaimer that osu_game_mode is gonna be applied for all kinds of stuff to prevent obtaining info about other gamemodes.
13. So the game is gonna be tied to the user played beatmaps on the selected game mode.
    The random !beatmapset! will be chosen and bot gives 'RANDOM INFO' about it:
    So yeah, the querying osu api v2 is kind of inevitable for now, but whatever, my database is messed up anyways.

    Random info for now:
    Mapper,
    Some part of bg,
    Top diff name

    Any user can play that game in the guild.
    The reply '^hint' can be used to get other random info.

    If any of that not helps the game is over, so the map artist OR song name should be guessed.
