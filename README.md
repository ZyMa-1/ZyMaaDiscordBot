Discord bot with a bunch of cool commands build around Osu! (the game)

[Add the bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1147875605052915823&permissions=8&scope=bot)

Commands provide a bunch of statistics, and yeah that is all.

## Commands

Not updating, use '^help' to see recent updates on commands.

## Settings up the bot

To make the bot running, the following environment variables should be set (in '.env' file or somewhere else):

```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=
OSU_APIV2_CLIENT_ID=
OSU_APIV2_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

The Python version should be 3.10 and all the requirements should be satisfied.

Starting point of the bot is `start.py`.
