# ZyMaaDiscordBot
Just a bot I made to interact with Osu! Api with a bunch of commands

What I learned:
- Discord bot events
- Predicates and checks before a command
- Async, Await usage
- Rate limiting requests (kinda silly way)
- You can attach sync api to async things does not matter
- Managing some singleton classes in a whole project
- Default help command invokes predicates for no reason
- PathManager is kinda cool to have in all projects, how to create
- How to terminate one async task when other is finished and obtain the result (assume you have pair of tasks)
- Api pagitation via Cursor
- How to perform Async File/Database operations
